# Psychic-Game
Letter guess game

This game will compare the letter that the user keys in with a randomly generated letter for the computer. If the letters match, the wins will increment by 1. If the letters don't match, the losses will increment by 1. The user will have a total of 10 guesses before the game resets.

If the user has at least 6 wins, they win the game. If they have at least 6 losses, they lose the game.

Steps for completing the game:
1. Create an event that will display the letter that the user has created
2. Have the computer randomly come up with a letter
3. If the two guesses match, increment the wins by 1
4. If the two guesses don't match, increment the losses by 1
5. Continue to allow the user to guess until all ten guesses have been used
6. Based on the number of wins and losses, have the computer display if the user won the game or not
7. Reset the guesses back to 0 in order to allow the user to play again
